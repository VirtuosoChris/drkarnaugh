Current Project todo list:]


Update from Chris: Gameplay code should properly evaluate puzzles when the user clicks on the exit (with or without a wire, so the user can hook up shit and then change stuff at the beginning without having to reconnect other stuff.  Cycles are now prevented (can see with the NO icon and help message) Null pointer exception is caught.  

I see that the checkTruthTable function that saved me a crapload of work takes an int truth table-- i convert it when it needs to be checked, but i assume this is so we can have "don't care"s?  That would add an interesting dimension to the puzzles maybe?

Also it works but the user has no idea right now if their solution is right until they click on the exit and it either does nothing or it loads a map.  This weekend I'm thinking about adding like, a little gem on the corner of the screen that's either green or red, to show whether the current cycle matches the desired output.  I say a single instead of one for each combo because theres up to 256 combos and that'll uh... clutter the screen a little.  


Priority Features:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

MazeItem render methods

Bunny: Rendering, Animation, Pathfinding, "interaction" with player

the Goggles

Wire dragging


Local High Score Table/User Account files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Local high score table Displays users in a list in order, with total score, since, "best game" for custom is pretty worthless, followed by best ranked game score eg 

User   Total Points     Best Ranked Game
Chris  100000           100

Can click on a particular user name for a popup with more information, extracted from the file:
total points, best game score, best map score, best ranked game score, total time played, etc.  

Modify online code to store users, so we can display top users in addition to top scores

Must select or create an account before playing

Prettify and polish EVERYTHING

Toggle tips option

Restart map option

STATUS BAR FONTS: I cleared some space by making the max number of inputs 8, which still has a truth table size of 256, still plenty ridiculous for anything but the simplest puzzles.  There's room for 70 characters plus tghe maximum truth table display in 640x480 resolution, which I'm going to suggest as our minimum supported resolution-- but I do think that maybe we should include an option for the display bar font size when we get around to the options menu, because it is a little small at 1440x900 resolutions, and I know that a lot of gamers with high end systems run games in resolutions at least that high, sometimes significantly higher.
